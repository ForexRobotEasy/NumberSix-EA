## How it Works

The NumberSix EA code is written in MQL5 and utilizes several libraries for trading functions, candlestick pattern recognition, trend detection, and news filtering.

The code begins by defining the promotional price and escalation parameters. The promotional price is set at $299.00, and there are escalation purchases with an amount of $50.00 for every 10 purchases.

The main function, `OnStart()`, is responsible for executing the trading strategy if the current price of the product is below or equal to the promotional price. Otherwise, it displays a message indicating the price escalation.

The trading strategy is implemented in the `ExecuteScalpingStrategy()` function, which can be customized by the user. Similarly, the `CheckCandlestickPatterns()`, `DetectTrends()`, and `ApplyNewsFilter()` functions allow users to implement their own logic for candlestick pattern recognition, trend detection, and news filtering, respectively.

The `GetProductPrice()` function is a placeholder that returns a fixed value of $399.00 for demonstration purposes. In a real implementation, this function should retrieve the current price of the product from a data source or API.

1. Download and install the EA on your trading platform.
